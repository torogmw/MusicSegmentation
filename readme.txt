a music segmentation algorithm that I proposed and implemented as my undergraduate project. 
The basic function is: 
1. a song is loaded to the system, 
2. the system will calculate the chroma(harmonic) and MFCC(timbre) features of the audio input 
3. find the segmentation label by using similarity matrix. 
4. Then output the segmented time information of this song
